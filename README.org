/Log All The Things!/

** Description
This /in early development/ library is to provide logging faculty.

** Usage
+ Create a logger
+ Use the logger

** Installation
Put it on the path and load it, or wait the melpa recipe to it the ground!

** Notes
This is still a prototype. I use it on my =omni-quotes= package, but API is not frozen yet.

*If you have any remark, refactor suggestion or else, just pose an issue ;)
